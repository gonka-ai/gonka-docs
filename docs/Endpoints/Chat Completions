To use one of these models via the OpenAI API, you’ll send a request to the Chat Completions API containing the inputs and your API key, and receive a response containing the model’s output.

You can experiment with various models in the chat playground. If you’re not sure which model to use then try `gpt-4o` if you need high intelligence or gpt-4o-mini if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost.
