**Developer instruction (inference consumer)**

**Prerequisites**

1. Install `inferenced` app (In this instruction I propose to use our docker image)
2. Create `$HOME/.inference` folder (we'll be storing the keys there)
3. Create `$HOME/inference-requests` folder. Inside you can place your requests. See the attached example: `request_payload.json`
4. Run our docker container in terminal mode to access `inferenced` binary
