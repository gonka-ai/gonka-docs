# Internal onboarding guide

1. Find Your Gonka Blockchain Address

Once created, your wallet will automatically give you an account address.

It looks like a long string of letters and numbers (e.g., gonka1... ).

This address is public—you can safely share it with others to receive payments.

2. Sharing Your Address Safely

Always copy and paste your address (don’t type it by hand).

Double-check the first and last 4 characters before sending.

Some wallets let you generate a QR code—useful for in-person sharing.

You never share your seed phrase or private key. Only the public address is for sharing.

3.. Receiving Crypto

Give your public address to the sender.

Once they send funds, you can check your wallet balance or look up your address on a block explorer (like [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [Blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/), or [Solscan](https://solscan.io/)).
