#Stealth-mode blockchain project

"Stealth-mode blockchain project" is a decentralized AI infrastructure designed to optimize computational power specifically for AI model training and inference, offering a competitive alternative to traditional centralized cloud providers. Centralized systems are often expensive, monopolistic, and carry risks of censorship, while existing decentralized networks frequently waste resources on non-productive tasks like network security.

"Stealth-mode blockchain project" introduces an innovative consensus mechanism that ensures nearly **100%** of computational resources are used for meaningful AI tasks, maximizing efficiency and minimizing operational costs. By democratizing access to advanced AI capabilities, "Stealth-mode blockchain project" empowers developers and businesses with cost-effective, flexible, and transparent solutions free from the limitations and control of centralized providers.

The system features key roles: 

- **developers** build and deploy AI applications using the network’s distributed power;
- **participants** (or **hardware providers**) contribute computational resources and earn rewards based on their input.

This collaboration allows the platform to offer AI services at significantly lower prices, making advanced AI technology more accessible to a broader audience.
