#Stealth-mode blockchain project

Our stealth blockchain project is a decentralized AI infrastructure designed to optimize computational power specifically for AI model training and inference, offering a competitive alternative to traditional centralized cloud providers. Centralized systems are often expensive, monopolistic, and carry risks of censorship, while existing decentralized networks frequently waste resources on non-productive tasks like network security.

We introduce an innovative consensus mechanism that ensures nearly **100%** of computational resources are used for meaningful AI tasks, maximizing efficiency and minimizing operational costs. 

The system features key roles: 

- **developers** build and deploy AI applications using the network’s distributed power;
- **participants (hardware providers or nodes)** contribute computational resources to the network and are rewarded based on the amount and quality of resources they provide.

This collaboration allows the platform to offer AI services at significantly lower prices, making advanced AI technology more accessible to a broader audience.
