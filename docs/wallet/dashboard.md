# Getting Started with the Dashboard
The Gonka Dashboard on Ping.pub is your main interface to interact with the network. It lets you observe live on-chain activity, manage your wallet-linked developer accounts, and analyze inference workloads and token usage in real time. Before using the dashboard features, you need to connect your wallet. Once your wallet is connected, the dashboard becomes fully interactive, showing detailed token balances, live metrics, and inference analytics.

## 1. Gonka Account
To use the dashboard, you need a Gonka account.

- Already have one? Proceed to Set Up Keplr Wallet
- New user? Visit the Developer or Host Quickstart to create an account.

## 2. Set Up Keplr Wallet
To interact with the Gonka network through your wallet, we recommend using [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) (a browser extension wallet built for Cosmos-based chains).

- If you have a Keplr wallet, proceed to Step 3.
