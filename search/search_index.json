Unlike Proof of Work, Proof of Compute concentrates the proving part (Sprint) in a short limited time window, freeing the rest of the time for the useful work (in our case LLM inference).  Gonka operates in epochs, each epoch lasts 17280 blocks (approximately 24 hours). </p> <p>Each epoch follows a strict sequence that ties Sprint execution, Hosts activity, and reward settlement into a cohesive flow. </p> <p>Each Sprint begins simultaneously for all Hosts, ensuring fairness by eliminating any advantage based on timing (much like a starting gun in a race, where no Host may begin early). This synchronous start is coordinated using a random seed that cannot be predicted or influenced beforehand. All Hosts with voting power contribute to generating this seed, preventing any minority set of Hosts from pre-computing or gaining an unfair edge. </p> <p>Sprints are deliberately short, concentrating computational effort into a tightly bounded and efficient window. They occur at regular, precisely defined intervals aligned with blockchain block production, taking only a small fraction of the total epoch length.

The claim is retried every 30 minutes until it succeeds. Importantly, the Host must remain online and pass all verification checks within this limited window, otherwise, the chain cannot finalize the claim, and the reward remains unclaimed. Unclaimed rewards from earlier epochs  (epoch N) are permanently burned as soon as epoch N+2 begins.</p> <p>As part of the claim process, the chain verifies that Host completed all required work for the epoch.

Next, open the extension and log in to your wallet. Once you are logged in, follow the steps below to add Gonka network to your wallet and continue with the setup process.</p> <p>This guide explains how to create a Gonka Network account using the inferenced CLI tool. Download the <code>inferenced</code> CLI tool (the latest <code>inferenced</code> binary for your system is here).</p> <p>What is the inferenced CLI tool?</p> <p>The <code>inferenced</code> CLI tool is a command-line interface utility used to interact with the Gonka network. It is a standalone, executable binary that allows users to create and manage Gonka accounts, perform inference tasks, upload models, and automate various operations through scripted commands.</p> <p>Before creating an account, set up the required environment variables:</p> <pre><code>export ACCOUNT_NAME=&lt;your-desired-account-name&gt;\nexport NODE_URL=&lt;http://random-node-url&gt;\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Replace <code>&lt;your-desired-account-name&gt;</code> with your chosen account name.</li> </ul> Things to know about account names <p>This name is not recorded on-chain \u2014 it exists only in your local key store. Uniqueness is local: creating two keys with the same name will overwrite the existing one (with a CLI warning). If you proceed, the original key will be permanently lost. It is highly recommended to back up your public and private keys before performing this operation.</p> <ul> <li>Replace <code>&lt;http://random-node-url&gt;</code> with a random Node URL. You can either:<ul> <li>Use one of the genesis nodes from the list below.</li> <li>Fetch the current list of active participants and select a random node.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Do not forget to write it down, you will need it in the next step.</p> Why a random node? <p>To avoid over-reliance on the genesis node and encourage decentralization, Gonka recommends selecting a random active node from the current epoch. This improves network load distribution and resilience to node outages.</p> How to choose a Node URL? <p>You can choose any node randomly \u2014 you do not need to consider which model it runs. At this point, the node is used purely as a gateway to fetch network state and broadcast transactions. All nodes expose the same public API.</p> Genesis nodesCurrent list of active participants <p>Set the <code>NODE_URL</code> to one of the genesis nodes: </p>Genesis Node List<pre><code>http://185.216.21.98:8000\nhttp://36.189.234.197:18026\nhttp://36.189.234.237:17241\nhttp://node1.gonka.ai:8000\nhttp://node2.gonka.ai:8000\nhttp://node3.gonka.ai:8000\nhttp://47.236.26.199:8000\nhttp://47.236.19.22:18000\nhttp://gonka.spv.re:8000\n</code></pre> <p>Alternatively, you can select a random active participant from the current epoch. Open the link or run the following command to fetch the list of active participants along with a cryptographic proof for verification:</p> LinkCommand <p>http://node2.gonka.ai:8000/v1/epochs/current/participants</p> <pre><code>curl http://node2.gonka.ai:8000/v1/epochs/current/participants\n</code></pre> <p>Download the <code>inferenced</code> CLI tool (the latest <code>inferenced</code> binary for your system is here).</p> Enabling Execution on Mac OS <p>On Mac OS, after downloading the inferenced binary, you may need to enable execution permissions manually. Follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the binary is located.</p> </li> <li> <p>Run the following command to grant execution permission: </p><pre><code>chmod +x inferenced\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Try running <code>./inferenced --help</code> to ensure it's working.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you see a security warning when trying to run <code>inferenced</code>, go to System Settings \u2192 Privacy &amp; Security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scroll down to the warning about <code>inferenced</code> and click \"Allow Anyway\".</p> </li> </ol> <p>You can create an account with the following command: </p><pre><code>./inferenced create-client $ACCOUNT_NAME \\\n     --node-address $NODE_URL\n</code></pre> <p>Make sure to securely save your passphrase \u2014 you'll need it for future access.</p> <p>This command will:</p> <ul> <li>Generate a keypair</li> <li>Save it to <code>~/.inference</code></li> <li>Return your account address, public key, and mnemonic phrase (store it securely in a hard copy as well!)</li> </ul> <pre><code>- address: &lt;your-account-address&gt;\n  name: ACCOUNT_NAME\n  pubkey: '{\"@type\":\"...\",\"key\":\"...\"}'\n  type: local\n</code></pre> <p>You will use this account address to receive payments. This is your public address, and it is safe to share.</p> <p>To access your Gonka private key, export your private key and store it securely. The command below outputs a plain-text private key. A private key is a secret code that gives full access to your wallet and the funds inside it.

By eliminating centralized identity, Gonka removes the traditional single point of failure that plagues SaaS-based AI services. Here is a quick comparison table to help you understand the differences between a Traditional AI API and the Gonka API.</p> Aspect Traditional AI API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) Gonka API Model provenance &amp; verifiable output Models are hosted and versioned by the provider, but there\u2019s no way to cryptographically verify which model actually produced a given output. There\u2019s no proof that the model wasn\u2019t switched, fine-tuned behind the scenes, or A/B tested on you. Every inference request and response can be cryptographically linked to a specific model hash and execution environment. This enables verifiable provenance \u2014 anyone can prove that a particular model version generated a specific output. Censorship resistance All access is controlled centrally \u2014 providers can restrict or terminate accounts at any time. This includes enforcement of geographic, political, or commercial policies. Inference requests are signed and broadcast through a decentralized network. As long as you hold your private key and connect to a node, you can run inference. The system is designed to be uncensorable, unless restrictions are applied by a transparent, protocol-level consensus. Auditability &amp; transparency Logging, billing, and usage tracking are fully controlled by the API provider. Users cannot independently verify their own usage or inspect how pricing, latency, or errors were handled. Every interaction is signed and timestamped, enabling independent audit trails. You can prove when and how an inference occurred, which model was used, whether the results were altered, and ensure that disputes can be publicly resolved. Transparent tokenomics Billing rates have limited insight into compute pricing, model costs, or system load. Tokenomics are on-chain or protocol-defined, meaning pricing mechanisms are transparent and inspectable. Users convert GNK into AI Tokens with predictable, traceable exchange logic, enabling clear forecasting of inference costs and supply-demand\u2013driven economics."},{"location":"developer/quickstart/#1-define-variables","title":"1.
